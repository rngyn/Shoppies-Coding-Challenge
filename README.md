# Shopify Coding Challenge: The Shoppies
**Welcome to the Shoppies!**

This web application uses the Open Movie Database (OMDb) API to grab a list of movies based on the user's search input.
The user can click the nominate button when hovering over a movie poster to add it to the nominations list. Up to five
nominations can be made before an alert is shown preventing further nominations. The nominate button is disabled if the movie
is already in the nominations list. Removal of nominees can be made right from the nomination list if the user changes their mind.
